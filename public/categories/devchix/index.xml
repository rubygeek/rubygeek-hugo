      <description>For this years Finding Adapost, I would like to highlight several members of DevChix and their contributions and inspirations to the group.
Desi McAdam- One of the co-founders of DevChix. She is always there to put some perspective on things and teach me about diplomacy. Sometimes I get frustrated and speak without thinking things though :)
Susan Potter- Very technical and has very good reasons for why and how she does things.</description>

      <description>Sometime ago a co-worker asked me what my github name was. I had forgotten..I hadn&#39;t used it in so long! He was surprised that I didn&#39;t have any open source code out there! I said, umm..I haven&#39;t written anything I think someone would want!
I tend to start projects, work a bit on them and leave them. I find something new and exciting. I get busy with school, work, and life.</description>
