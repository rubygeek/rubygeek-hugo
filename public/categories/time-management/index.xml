      <description>Some one asked me how I manage my tasks and I showed him but I thought it would make for a good blog post. I&#39;m not saying I am the perfect solution but this is what works for me.
For long term storage of projects, tasks and ideas I use Omnifocus. I have used it for 7 years. I initially got a free copy of the Mac app because I know someone who works there but since then I&#39;ve paid for updates and bought it for iPhone and iPad.</description>

      <description>In my constant battle to get stuff done and feel good about what I did, I am finding the Pomodoro Methodvery handy.
Basically you set a timer for 25 mins, work unhindered for that time, then take a 5 minute break. Repeat 3 more times, then take a 15-20 min break. This has helped me for a few reasons
 If my task is BORING.. I procrastinate, go read facebook, email a friend.</description>
