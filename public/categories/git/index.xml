      <description>In the past few weeks I&#39;ve been doing alot of Git and alot more collaboration with people on projects! So I wanted to point out some of the things i&#39;ve learned and some handy tips I picked up.
I was pairing with aimeeremotely and she showed me how to &amp;ldquo;stage&amp;rdquo; a commit. Which is a way to indicate &amp;ldquo;HEY this is going to be committed when you do git commit!&amp;rdquo; I used to always do commit -a which adds all the files not currently in the staging.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m watching the Git peepcode by Geoffrey Grosenbachand as usual with other peepcode screencasts it is very good. This is the ultimate in geek-tv. I swear, i will burn these to a DVD sometime so i can watch them on my tv! :)
Things I like about git so far:
 branching, since I am often on the road without internet access. clean, just creates one .git dir in your project root.</description>
