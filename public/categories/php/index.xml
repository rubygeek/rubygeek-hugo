Update: Chris Shiflett posted an informative responseon Test-More for PHP and testing in general
I started responding to the comment to my last post, then realized it was going to be long. So I put it in a post.
Thanks Damien Gilles, I have looked at that. Problem is, I have some resistance at work to using outside code. So I would need to work up a case for it beforehand and analyize it.</description>

My two loyal readers know I like testing. Some say I&#39;m sick.
I&#39;m writing a PHP class for a user, and then think.. oh gee, how do I know if this works?? oh I&#39;ll write a Test::Simple for PHP. Yes, I know there exists one already that uses the power of Perl to test PHP files, but I didn&#39;t have time to figure out how to set that up and probably won&#39;t be able to use perl anyways on the production system.</description>
