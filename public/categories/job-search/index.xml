      <description>You probably use open source software if you are programmer and you know you should probably at some point give back right? I&#39;ve been programming since I was a kid and working as a professional programmer for 17 years (at the time of this post). I freaking love code but I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;ve contributed a lot in the past years. :(
I want to talk about some of my experiences and what you can do to get started.</description>

      <description>I recently went through this process so I thought it would be good to share what I think are good things to do to prepare for an interview.
Logistics Arrive early, sit in your car or outside and walk in 15 mins before (I&#39;m kind of paranoid, so I get there 30 mins before usually). Ask me about a job I didn&#39;t get (years ago) because I was late. Hey, I had a good reason, they changed the time on me and mentioned it an attachment (not the body of the email) that I didn&#39;t notice was there.</description>
