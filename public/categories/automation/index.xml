      <description>Recently I&#39;ve been working with a QA team and I&#39;ve learned how to test the browser from them and have came up with some of my own ideas learning from Trial and Error. I have spent close to 1.5 years doing Automation Testing whereas previously I&#39;ve always been a test obsessed developer with little in the way of browser testing.
This post is focusing on testing the browser and automating the tests.</description>

      <description>Robot framework is a test automation framework. There are many uses for it, but I use it for selenium web testing. But no matter what you test you can use it for many things.
Jenkins a tool to manage &amp;ldquo;jobs&amp;rdquo;, segments of work that you might use &amp;ldquo;cron&amp;rdquo; for.
I use it to run robot framework tests nightly or every 6 hours, or whatever you need.
Jenkins is breeze to set up (at least on mac) and once installed search in the plugins for the robot framework plugin.</description>

      <title>Tagging in Robot Framework</title>

      <description>I talked about the awesome robot framework in the previous post and I wanted to talk about Tagging since I think this is very useful.
Tagging is one way to group tests so you run a subset of tests. In your test case, add this:
Homepage Loads [Tags] smoke Open Homepage Element Should Be Visible ${FIND_LOGO} [Teardown] Close Browser Results to run just one tag:
â–¶ robot --include smoke youtube.robot ============================================================================== Youtube :: A test to demo testing YouTube ============================================================================== Homepage Loads | PASS | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Search Loads Results | PASS | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Youtube :: A test to demo testing YouTube | PASS | 2 critical tests, 2 passed, 0 failed 2 tests total, 2 passed, 0 failed ============================================================================== You can create a focus so it is easy to run that one test as you are developing it.</description>

      <description>On one of my projects recently, I was tasked with finding an automation framework. Looking at my options..
 Cucumber (ruby, although other languages could be used) Capybara / Rspec (ruby) Robot Framework (python)  All of the options for web testing use either Selenium or Watir. I have only did a little with Watir, so I focused on something with Selenium for my first pass of experimentation.
I love testing if you know anything about me, I&#39;m nuts about testing.</description>
