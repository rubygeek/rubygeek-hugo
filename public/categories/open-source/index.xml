      <description>You probably use open source software if you are programmer and you know you should probably at some point give back right? I&#39;ve been programming since I was a kid and working as a professional programmer for 17 years (at the time of this post). I freaking love code but I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;ve contributed a lot in the past years. :(
I want to talk about some of my experiences and what you can do to get started.</description>
