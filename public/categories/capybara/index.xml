      <description>If you know me, you know I love testing. Model tests, library tests (typically when poro objects) are the most awesome to test and I love it. Controller tests, well, are less fun and testing routes is not bad either. But my least favorite are integration tests.
Cucumber tests seemed awesome in theory and I remember early days in Chicago ruby group there was development on rspec story runner which I believed was written by Dan North, later rewritten as Cucumber.</description>
