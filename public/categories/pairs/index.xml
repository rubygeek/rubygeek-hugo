      <description>Seems like Pair Programming is &amp;ldquo;all the rage&amp;rdquo; lately in my circles. I haven&#39;t exactly done it before but after hearing about the success and rapid knowledge growth amongst those that pair program&amp;hellip;I was almost dying to try it! Especially after i saw David Chelimskyand Corey Hainesat WindyCityRailsin Sept 2009. I saw them pair and do BDD with Rspec/Cucumber and it was so fascinating, It was like I was watching a ballet as they hopped from RSpec to Cucumber and back and forth.</description>

      <description>Sometime ago a co-worker asked me what my github name was. I had forgotten..I hadn&#39;t used it in so long! He was surprised that I didn&#39;t have any open source code out there! I said, umm..I haven&#39;t written anything I think someone would want!
I tend to start projects, work a bit on them and leave them. I find something new and exciting. I get busy with school, work, and life.</description>
