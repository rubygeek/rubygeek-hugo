      <description>Recently I&#39;ve been working with a QA team and I&#39;ve learned how to test the browser from them and have came up with some of my own ideas learning from Trial and Error. I have spent close to 1.5 years doing Automation Testing whereas previously I&#39;ve always been a test obsessed developer with little in the way of browser testing.
This post is focusing on testing the browser and automating the tests.</description>

      <description>Robot framework is a test automation framework. There are many uses for it, but I use it for selenium web testing. But no matter what you test you can use it for many things.
Jenkins a tool to manage &amp;ldquo;jobs&amp;rdquo;, segments of work that you might use &amp;ldquo;cron&amp;rdquo; for.
I use it to run robot framework tests nightly or every 6 hours, or whatever you need.
Jenkins is breeze to set up (at least on mac) and once installed search in the plugins for the robot framework plugin.</description>
