				<p>A few friends have been telling me about tmux and since I've been using a mac full time again (rather than ssh into linux) I haven't used a screen multiplexer. I wrote awhile back about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting around with GNU Screen<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I really liked screen. I was listening to Changelog's podcast <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Episode 0.7.3 - Tmux with Brian Hogan and Josh Clayton<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on one of my walks, it seemed useful and better than screen. Then I remembered hey it was kind of useful to use a screen multiplexer (BTW, I love saying multiplexer. I feel smart, like I know what I am talking about, hehe). I got home from my walk and installed it and started with the links on the changelog show notes and not wanting to get overwhemed by just copying someone conf file, I started simple and added a few things:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># change default command sequenceÂ·</span>
unbind C-b 
set-option -g prefix C-a 

<span style="color:#75715e"># Start Window Numbering at 1</span>
set -g base-index <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>

<span style="color:#75715e"># Faster Command Sequences</span>
set -s escape-time <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>

<span style="color:#75715e"># force a reload of the config file</span>
unbind r
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf

<span style="color:#75715e"># quick pane cycling</span>
unbind ^A
bind ^A <span style="color:#66d9ef">select</span>-pane -t :.+ 
</code></pre></div><p>I used the default from screen, ctrl-a to go into command mode. Since that the combo used for screen, it seemed like a good idea. The second setting sets the numbering at 1, arguement for that is the 1 is probably closer to where you are typing and certainly closer to ctrl-a</p>
<p>The next 3 were just something I found, seemed like they'd be ok. Then I stopped adding to the conf and started trying it out.</p>
<p>I often alternate between textmate and macvim. I remembered from the podcast that one of the guys now just does entirely vim. Meh ok, I only like a few of the things in macvim, mostly scrolling and clicking to change panes. So i opened my project up and started working away.</p>
<p>I had a hard time figuring out how to get the split that one of the guys talked about, so once I found it made note of it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ctrl-a :
 split-window -p <span style="color:#ae81ff">25</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I used this page alot and copy and pasted some things to my own cheatsheet</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thoughtbot - A tmux crash course<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>One thing I really like is named sessions so I can have my own workspaces</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">tmux list-sessions

</code></pre></div><p>Great to remember what you were doing last!</p>
<p>Fun is where I work on something fun. I was digging into rails activesupport source code and reading the tests. koans is where I work through rubykoans (having it in a session makes it quick to switch and work on a few at a time). Its split down the middle with my console on one side and the code on the other. Work is well work :) I have it split 75/25 with vim at the top, and bottom is just the shell where i type my git commands, ack/grep. I have a second window with my rails server log going.</p>
<p>I even found a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pomodoro timer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that runs in the console.</p>
<p>Its working out good. I've started to work fullscreen  and keep clutter out of slight.  I think its a smoother flow than screen and I wish I had dived in sooner.</p>
<p>If you haven't tried a screen multiplexer give it a shot! Remember to start with a few commands at a time so you dont get overwhelmed!</p>
