<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I've been talking to folks and pondering this question..how to be effective (in a new to me) large untested project?  I was listening to <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/067-rr-gary-bernhardts-testing-style/">RubyRogues</a> and they mentioned this talk at Cascadia Ruby (I immedately recognize the name as one of the <a href="http://www.devchix.com">devchix</a> and they praised her talk <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1071-cascadiaruby2012-therapeutic-refactoring">Therapeutic Refactoring</a>. I've listened to it twice so far. Its kind of entertaining too!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/elight">Evan Light</a> mentioned this book <a href="http://amzn.to/2qMgjm8">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a> &hellip; I think I flipped through that once in 2008, the java examples made my eyes glaze over, but I should give it another chance. He gave a talk at (Lone Star Ruby Conference)[http://lonestarrubyconf.com] and refactored a bit of code by breaking it into chunks. His (slides)[http://elight.github.com/fdd/]. He didn't cover tests, but it shows practical ways to get started.</p>
<p>Finally, some practical techniques for diving into a codebase and starting to write tests. I think I have enough tips to get started as I dive into some code this week.</p>
