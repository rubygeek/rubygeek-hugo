				<p>On one of my projects recently, I was tasked with finding an automation framework. Looking at my options..</p>
<ul>
<li>Cucumber (ruby, although other languages could be used)</li>
<li>Capybara / Rspec (ruby)</li>
<li>Robot Framework (python)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the options for web testing use either Selenium or Watir. I have only did a little with Watir, so I focused on something with Selenium for my first pass of experimentation.</p>
<p>I love testing if you know anything about me, I'm nuts about testing. Front End Testing however has been fruitless IMHO .. until a few years ago I discovered <a href="https://github.com/cheezy/page-object">page objects</a> and it became tolerable to do frontend testing. My projects changed and I didn't really do much for a few years with web frontend testing.</p>
<p>Recently I have been looking into Python and discovered <a href="http://robotframework.org/">Robot Framework</a>, meant to test a variety of things in addition to the web. The Selenium2 package is especially nice.</p>
<p>You can have a robot script as a text field, in a TSV, or other types of strutured text. I find the text file works for me.</p>
<p>Here we can define a Test Case:</p>
<pre><code>Homepage Loads
  Open Browser  https://www.youtube.com  Firefox
  Element Should Be Visible  id=yt-masthead-logo-fragment 
  [Teardown]  Close Browser
</code></pre><p>This script opens the browser to youtube using firefox. Then checks that element located by id=yt-masthead-logo-fragment is visible (ie on the page, not display: none).</p>
<p>you must make sure to have two spaces between the elements</p>
<p>Open Browser<code>  </code><a href="https://www.youtube.com%60">https://www.youtube.com`</a>  `Firefox</p>
<p>Or it won't be able to parse. I guess this is when having it in a spreadsheet (TSV) would come in handy. But it's not too bad to get the hang of. Plus if you use nice editors like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> and the Robot Framework Plugin, it has nice syntax highlighting for you.</p>
<p>Running the test case like this:</p>
<pre><code>robot youtube.robot
</code></pre><p>And results look like this:</p>
<pre><code>â–¶ robot youtube.robot
==============================================================================
Youtube :: A test to demo testing YouTube

Report:  robot-demo/report.html
</code></pre><p>There that is just a taste of what it can do. If you want to see what all you need installed you can see my <a href="https://github.com/rubygeek/robot-demo">robot demo</a> and some more complex tests. More testing posts to come on this, I think this is a very excellent framework &hellip; even if it is not ruby :)</p>
