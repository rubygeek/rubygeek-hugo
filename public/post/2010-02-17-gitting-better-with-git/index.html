				<p>In the past few weeks I've been doing alot of Git and alot more collaboration with people on projects! So I wanted to point out some of the things i've learned and some handy tips I picked up.</p>
<p>I was <a href="/2010/02/11/remote-pair-programming/">pairing</a> with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->aimee<!-- raw HTML omitted --> remotely and she showed me how to &ldquo;stage&rdquo; a commit. Which is a way to indicate &ldquo;HEY this is going to be committed when you do git commit!&rdquo; I used to always do commit -a  which adds all the files not currently in the staging. I used perforce for awhile and learned how nice it was to have a &ldquo;change list&rdquo; and how you can commit only certain files at a time. Git seems like you can only have one &ldquo;change list&rdquo; at a time but that is fine in most cases.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
git add -p
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It will go through each changed file and ask if you want to stage this hunk. We were able to see what files we had changed as it showed a diff. You can confirm or deny chunk by chunk. today I like to run it to make sure I didn't accidentally change a file. I have a habit of leaving a file open, walking away and coming back and adjusting the spacing. Probably not something I need to in a commit.</p>
<pre><code>git status
</code></pre><p>This is really cool command, not only does it show you what is in staging it tells you what to do with the other files to either add/remove etc to get the commit in the shape you want.  After working with git more, i went back and re-watched the <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/git">peepcode screencast</a> on git. I understand it better now!</p>
<p>After we committed, we realized we made a mistake in log message, so we did</p>
<pre><code>git commit --amend
</code></pre><p>It will amend the last message in your git repo. I recently tried this with one of my commits, but I had already pushed to origin. I was kind of confused, so I asked aimee, she said</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another sticky point for me was &ndash; what is inverse of git add? git rm? I keep a <a href="http://github.com/rubygeek/rubygeek">git repo</a> of code I am working on as I to learn stuff, practice etc. Most if it is probably not really worth browsing, but i like to point my friends there when I talk about what I am doing.  I wanted to clean up some stuff that I don't want to keep and mistakenly thought if I git rm it would remove it from the staging. Nope, it removes it! Well, to revert a file back to what you use this:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -- file.txt
</code></pre><p>more on this <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitFaq#Why_is_.22git_rm.22_not_the_inverse_of_.22git_add.22.3F">Why is &ldquo;git rm&rdquo; not the inverse of &ldquo;git add&rdquo;?</a></p>
<p>Anyways, a few tidbits of information I've learned recently, hope this can help you git better at git :)</p>
