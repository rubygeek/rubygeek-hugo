				<p>Javascript. It's a language that some of us love to hate, me occasionally. Here's a few notes to myself to make JS a little better :)</p>
<p>Use these settings in JSHint to avoid instanity:</p>
<pre><code>file: .jshintrc
{
  &quot;flagname&quot; : true
}
</code></pre><p>If you have settings that apply to only your test environment you can put those in <code>test/.jshintrc</code> (maybe allowing global var for your test function) .. you can extend a confiuration in another file with this option `&quot;extends&rdquo; : &ldquo;../.jshintrc&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes you just can't please everyone, including the linter. Here's how to ignore blocks or lines from the linter:</p>
<p>To ignore a block of code use</p>
<pre><code>/* jshint ignore:start */
myBadJsHere
/* jshint ignore:end */
</code></pre><p>to just ignore a single line:</p>
<pre><code>myBadJsHere // jshint ignore:line
</code></pre><p>Obviously you shouldn't let the linter ignore code but you may have a good reason to do so.</p>
<p>Handy thing to have in your .jshintrc file:</p>
<p><code>eqeqeq</code></p>
<p>1 != &ldquo;1&rdquo; right? comparing a number to a string? no, JS says sure its the same using automatic type conversion. Use this flag to warn you and remind you to use triple equals to not do automagic type conversion.</p>
<p>Switch statements</p>
<p>This was just a neat thing I learned today,  in JS switch/case statements you need to do a return or break or you will fall through to the next option. Leave a note for the next guy that says you did mean to fall through with a comment <code>/* falls through */</code> and you will silence the warning from jslint. Kinda cool, huh?</p>
<p>Use Strict</p>
<p><code>&quot;use strict&quot;;</code></p>
<p>This tells javascript to cut the funny business and not be so helpful and error when stuff should error.</p>
<p>I picked up some of these tips watching <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-best-practices/table-of-contents">Pluralsight: JavaScript Best Practices</a></p>
<p>Thanks for humoring me as I write these notes to myself :)</p>
