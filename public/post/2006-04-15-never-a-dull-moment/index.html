				<p>First of all, thanks to some howtos at <a href="http://wiki.ubuntu.com">http://wiki.ubuntu.com</a> I was able to get my video drivers setup. Now I'm basking in 1680x1050 glory. I can have windows side by side &ndash; almost&hellip; i usually shrink the window a bit. Very nice. People have asked me about my laptop, I got it from PowerNotebooks, this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->model.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  At the recent group meetings I've been at, people go &ldquo;Wow .. thats some laptop!&quot;. In fact on the train ride to the perl meeting, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Josh McAdams<!-- raw HTML omitted --> whips out his cute little 12 inch mac, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->brian d foy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> his mid sized mac.. and here I am with my honking thing! I said look: daddy bear, momma bear and baby bear! hehe.. it was funny.</p>
<p>Last friday night and saturday I was at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cit-Con<!-- raw HTML omitted --> testing conference. It was great, they had a variety of topics and although some weren't really in my line of work I found them interesting. I got to talk to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jason Huggings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, author of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Selenium<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Andy Lester<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, owner of the perl package <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WWW::Mechanize<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They did a &ldquo;Battle of the web testing packages&rdquo; of some sort. Andy talked about Mech, and the advantages over Selenium&hellip;then Josh defended himself and talked about the pros of Selenium.</p>
<p>While I was there, Pete helped me with my laptop. I couldn't install Perl modules and I wasn't sure why. He looked at it and said I needed cc or gcc. So along with more help from Andy (I'm sure they were tired of me by end of day) I was able to get it installed..and off I go. I've installed Mechanize and tried it out, pretty nifty.</p>
<p>The following Tuesday, I went to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->UniForm Chicago SIG Perl Meeting<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where  Josh McAdams gave an extremely interesting talk on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perl::Critic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which  will check your code for standards suggested in the Perl Best Practices book (very good read, even for PHP programmers). Very handy, I'm sure I will be using it alot. We had some fun and ran it on brian d foy and Andy Lesters code. heehehe.. they did ok :)</p>
<p>Now that I've been able to install Perl modules, I've been playing around with Andy Lesters <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How We Doin'<!-- raw HTML omitted --> module. Kinda nice.. can't get GNU Plot thing to work, I'll keep trying :)</p>
