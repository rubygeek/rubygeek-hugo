<p>I go to the RubyOnRails.com download page to see what the latest version of Ruby is, so I can install it on my Ubuntu VM (downloaded from vmware list of virtual appliances, and running with VMWare player). I was pretty sure it was 1.8.4 but I know there is one version that won't work&hellip; and whoa, its version 1.8.5 .. I look in my ubuntu package manager .. and they only have 1.8.4 - always up for a challenge i thought I'd try to compile it myself.</p>
<p>I had to install &ldquo;build-essential&rdquo; to get all the goodies &ldquo;ld&rdquo; in particular, that it complained about the first time I ran make. Here's what I did:</p>
<p>Downloaded source from <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/down">www.rubyonrails.com/down</a></p>
<p>sudo apt-get install build-essential</p>
<p>tar xvfzp ::downloaded file from rails:: and CD into that dir</p>
<p>sudo ./configure</p>
<p>sudo make</p>
<p>sudo make test</p>
<p>sudo make install</p>
<p>(don't forget the sudo! or you may get strange errors!)</p>
<p>Then, to double check and revel in your accomplishment do:</p>
<p>ruby -v</p>
<p>Ahh! wham-bam and you are on the latest and greatest release version! Also while I was at it, I peeked at the source, poked around a bit and was thankful there are a great deal of people smarter than I who wrote this wonderful language.</p>
