				<p>Some one asked me how I manage my tasks and I showed him but I thought it would make for a good blog post. I'm not saying I am the perfect solution but this is what works for me.</p>
<p>For long term storage of projects, tasks and ideas I use <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">Omnifocus</a>. I have used it for 7 years. I initially got a free copy of the Mac app because I know someone who works there but since then I've paid for updates and bought it for iPhone and iPad. It is really handy for whatever device I have in my hand at the moment. They provide a sync service so all my apps are in sync. I can put ideas into the Omnifocus &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; via my phone then later put them in the right place when I am on my mac. Omnifocus is only available on apple platforms.</p>
<p>The key feature for me with Omnifocus is the Review Tab, which I often use the iPad. It steps through each project allowing you to change due dates for tasks, flag, or delete.</p>
<p>No system will work unless you have a way to review! You can use a spreadsheet, stack of index cards (See <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda">hipster pda</a>) or <a href="https://trello.com">trello</a>. But unless you review regularly it is <em>junk</em>. The fact this is one of the side tabs in Omnifocus is Review is the #1 reason I have used it this long.</p>
<p>If you are disciplined enough to review  without that, then good for you. Maybe you don't need Omnifocus :).</p>
<p>For very short term (ie todo this week) I've used a variety of things. <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a>. Google Spreadsheets. Index cards &hellip; right now I have been using <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org mode</a> in emacs partly for fun to learn it. I commit the files to github in a private repo. I use org-pomadoro to set a 25 minute timer (especially when I really need to focus) and it makes a log section under the task.</p>
<p>This time last year, I was using index cards. One per project, with tasks written out. When I was working on a project I would put that card on top to remind me to stay focused. When I was done, I recorded the project done in OmniFocus and threw the card away.</p>
<p>And even longer ago, I used Google Spreadsheets. I had one tab per project with the tasks listed out. It was easy to get to on multiple devices (hard to edit on a phone but not impossible).</p>
<p>I get bored easy, so maybe thats why I switch my short term tasks planning, but that keeps it fun.</p>
<p>Anyways, hope I've given you some ideas on manging your own tasks, both long term and short term :)</p>
