				<p>I have a big family scattered through the United States, so we do road trips. My husband drives while I code :) On my last road trip I wrote these notes:</p>
<p>Bring some things to do that don't require wifi. If you have a <a href="http://zfer.us/vUCTK">codeschool</a> account, download some of the videos to watch. You may not have the bandwidth to do the exercises and play along but you can at least watch the videos.</p>
<p>Plan on sitting in the back of the car/van so you can be away from the front windows &ndash; it can be so bright! it makes it hard to see the screen. For my Expedition I have some window cling screens to block the bright sun (and keep it cooler in the back!) and it works pretty well.</p>
<p>Bring an extra laptop charger. I usually travel with two, one in my bag and one in my suitcase. Because of that ONE time I left my charger in the hotel and I needed it for a presentation! When I am in the hotel I use the one in the suitcase, other places I use the one in my bag. Same goes with other chargers (phone, ipad etc).</p>
<p>I have this <a href="http://amzn.to/2sENSar">adapter</a> to plug in my laptop and my usb cables.</p>
<p>Use your Ipad (or other tablet) to read tech books or look up code. To that end, get some <a href="http://www.rubygeek.com/getting-started">good books</a>, you can use search and it is almost as good as looking up docs online.</p>
<p>Listen to Podcasts. Here's a list of my <a href="http://www.rubygeek.com/2017/05/14/my-favorite-tech-podcasts/">favorite podcasts</a>. Just make sure to download them ahead of time if you are in the waste lands of West Texas where they don't have cell phone towers.</p>
<p>Koans, I have a <a href="http://blog.rubygeek.com/2011/01/22/koan-a-copia/">list of koans</a> which are small tests to complete to help you learn coding.</p>
<p>Brainstorming, you may find the somewhat quietness of a roadtrip to be a perfect time to brainstorm and come up with ideas.</p>
<p>Happy Travels</p>
