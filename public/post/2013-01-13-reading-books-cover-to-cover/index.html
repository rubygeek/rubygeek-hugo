				<p>I wanted to buy &ldquo;Practical Object-Orientated Design in Ruby&rdquo; by Sandi Metz when it first came out, and I had a hard time justifying it because there are many books I have bought and have not read all the way through. So I thought I'd do an experiment in reading a tech book cover-to-cover and then I'll buy &ldquo;poodr&rdquo;. So my first cover-to-cover read was <a href="http://amzn.to/2sr51VC">Eloquent Ruby by Russ Olsen</a>. Not all books should be read cover-to-cover but when you read a book cover-to-cover you'll discover a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>what topics are there and how deep they are</li>
<li>what topics are not</li>
<li>the sequence and structure of the book, about where things are so its easier to flip back to review</li>
</ul>
<p>And lastly, you'll be able to speak authoritatively to someone when you say &ldquo;Read this book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bought <a href="http://amzn.to/2sr51VC">Eloquent Ruby</a> perhaps 1.5 years ago, and after the first couple chapters decided it was the most awesome book ever and how much smarter I would have been had I gotten it sooner. I read maybe 1/3 of the way through, I skipped around some,  the testing chapters and the metaprogramming. Even with skipping around in the book, I quickly became an evangelist for this book. I told every ruby developer I encountered to buy it, I even got a copy for my last company. It's just plain good, you'll learn the ruby idioms and why. I've been programming since I was 13 and got pretty good at memorizing the syntax of things, not truly understanding why or how, but &ldquo;type this thing to do that thing&rdquo;. But Eloquent Ruby helped me understand why behind the syntax. Now that I understand &ldquo;why&rdquo;, it is so much easier to remember without relying on memorization.</p>
<p>That is why I chose this book to read as my first cover-to-cover read.</p>
<p>I needed a way to keep track of my progress since I use different devices and software (mac, iphone, ipad, android nexus) I can't rely on a cloud service to &ldquo;sync my place&rdquo; across all of them. I use an Evernote note with all the chapters as a checkbox list. Plus, I love checking things off a list. I would see my progress and be able to pick back up where I left off each reading session. The chapters in Eloquent Ruby are pretty short, so it was easy to read in small chunks of time. I read it at break at work, on the bike at the gym, riding in car, just about anywhere. It took a couple months to get through all the chapters this way.</p>
<p>It didn't take long to realize one of the benefits of reading cover-to-cover. When I was almost done with the book, a friend was having problems with some concept in ruby and I remembered there was a chapter about it, near the beginning of the book. I flipped around a few minutes and found the prefect chapter for her to read. Had I not read it cover-to-cover I may not have known that content was there or wouldn't have been as confident recommending it and my &ldquo;find it in this chapter&rdquo; instructions.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;reward&rdquo; for finishing Eloquent Ruby was to get Sandi Metz's book <a href="http://amzn.to/2rEpQiu">&ldquo;Practical Object-Orientated Programming in Ruby&rdquo;</a>. Yay!</p>
<p>I followed the same process and created a list of chapters in Evernote, planning to read them in bits at home, gym and work breaks. At only 247 pages, it is quite a bit shorter than Eloquent Ruby with 447 pages so I knew it would take alot less time.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 came easily enough and I checked it off. Then I was surprised to find out what followed was that I could not put the book down. Instead of my next reading time or gym appointment, I read till 2 in the morning, picked back up and finished it the next  morning (it probably helped that I was home sick with the weekend to myself). I was so excited about what I was learning, I wanted to stop reading and refactor code I wrote a few days ago. I so wanted to skip ahead to Chapter 9 on tests. However, I stuck to original plan of cover-to-cover and read all the way through. It is an incredible book.</p>
<p>I say incredible not just because &ldquo;I learned the right way&rdquo; but because it validated so many instincts and gut feelings I have about class design. Having those things in writing gives a source to &ldquo;cite&rdquo; in discussions and confidence to say &ldquo;Yes, this is how we will do this thing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So as a result of my experiment I would recommend these two things to anyone wanting to improve their knowledge of ruby:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get these two books.</li>
<li>Read them cover-to-cover.</li>
</ol>
<p>Iâ€™m confident that you will enjoy both the information and the reading experience.</p>
